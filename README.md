# jamesdelay.dev

A portfolio website to showcase my projects, tinkerings, and other code-related things. Built using React, NextJS, remarkToHTML, & tailwindCSS. The articles are written in Markdown and server-side rendered using remarkToHTML. The site is deployed to Vercel and can be found [here](https://jamesdelay.dev).

## Tasks & Improvements:
- [ ] GitHub API to display "pinned" repos as Recent Projects - grab dates from commit 
- [ ] Refactor Post vs Project specific components & logic in the code; make it DRY
- [ ] Add more articles to blog
- [ ] Build out a "hobby" page
- [ ] Add Github flavored Markdown
