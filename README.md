# Showcase Site

A website to showcase the stuff I build. Built using NextJS, remarkToHTML, tailwindCSS.

## To Do:
- [] Use Next API call to fetch specific READMEs from GitHub and build them as remarkHTML blog pages
- [] Embed YouTube videos in snippets and expand functionality of "cool" stuff section
- [] Refactor Post vs Project specific logic in the code; make it DRY
