            I first discovered coding in my early teenage years, and it was love
            at first 'site'. I remember hacking away on a gargantuan white box
            of a computer, building websites with HTML, CSS, and Notepad. Though
            these "web pages" are now lost in the depths of my old hard drive, I
            continued to play around with code as a hobbyist programmer for
            years thereafter. It wasnâ€™t until later in my life, while pursuing
            my MBA, that I began to think of software engineering as a career
            path.

          <p className="font-sans mb-2">
            At that time, I was working as a carpenter during the day and taking
            graduate classes at night. While at work, I realized how much I
            enjoyed building things and solving the three-dimensional puzzles
            that carpentry presents. My favorite part of the job was coming up
            with creative ways to solve the difficult problems my team and I
            faced daily. I decided to combine this passion for building and
            creating with my love for code.
          </p>
          <p className="font-sans mb-2">
            This decision led me to The Fullstack Academy, where I studied
            software engineering and web development. After completing my
            studies at Fullstack, I was hired as a Teaching Fellow, where I
            taught and mentored aspiring software engineers. I then went on to
            work at Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. and subsequently McKinsey & Co.,
            where I currently work as a full-stack Software Engineer and
            Technical Consultant.
          </p>
          <p className="font-sans mb-2">
            During my tenure at McKinsey, I've worked on numerous applications,
            spanning geospatial analytic tools to PowerPoint automation scripts.
            I specialize in front-end web development and have extensive
            experience building responsive web applications. I am passionate
            about solving complex problems and experimenting with code.
